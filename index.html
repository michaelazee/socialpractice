		<p>During this pandemic, I've developed an appreciation for coding as an activity and something very therapeutic to me. Working as a journalism major has been challenging this year, especially since interviewing people and telling their stories feels less authentic when you've only met them through a screen. However, with coding, I am able to create something that conveys my personal aesthetic and can be shared with others.</p>

 <p>Feel free to contribute your feelings and thoughts onto this page, or anything that symbolizes your personality or what you've done during this pandemic.</p>
