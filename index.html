		<p>During this pandemic, I've developed an appreciation for coding as an activity and something very therapeutic to me. Working as a journalism major has been challenging this year, especially since interviewing people and telling their stories feels less authentic when you've only met them through a screen. However, with coding, I am able to create something that conveys my personal aesthetic and can be shared with others.</p>

 <p>Feel free to contribute your feelings and thoughts onto this page, or anything that symbolizes your personality or what you've done during this pandemic. For example, describe one thing you experienced during the pandemic, or attach a link to a Youtube video or your portfolio!</p>
